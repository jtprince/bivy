Step-by-Step
============

## 1. Create a Bibliographic Entry

Create an entry in your bibliography file (here called 'bib.yaml').  This can be done by hand or using pubmed_to_yaml.  If the pubmed ID is 17322870:

    pubmed_to_bivy.rb bib.yaml 17322870

**NOTE** If the full journal names are missing it may fail.  If so, just add
entries to the `medline_to_iso.yaml` and `medline_to_full.yaml` files.  On my
system these would be in
`/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/bib_writer-0.0.2/lib/journal/`

This will print the uniq ID to the screen (in this case, `Rinner2007`).  In any case, the uniq id is simply the hash key storing the entry in your yaml file. 

## 2. Use the unique identifier in your OpenOffice document

By default, citations are entered in your document like this:

    This is my text and following the citation. #[Rinner2007]

If I have two or more, I list with commas and no spaces:

    A multiple citation. #[Rinner2007,Jones2003,Panda2001]

## 3. Format the citations

In open office, we can use regular expressions to format all of our citations at once when we are ready for print quality:

    Edit -> Find and Replace

    -------------
    Search for:
    #\\[[^ ]*\\]
    Replace with:
    &
    -------------

    Click 'More Options' and check 'Regular expressions'
    Click on the 'Replace with' box and then the 'Format' box
    and add whatever formatting you desire.
    Then click 'Replace All'

(if you are reading the text source version of this page, you should replace
the two backslashes with one)

## 4. Substitute citations and build bibliography:

We read the citations, reformat them, and create a bibliography:

    bivy.rb bib.yaml MyDoc.odt

This will output two files: `MyDoc.bib.html` and `MyDoc.cit.odt`.  The
`.cit.odt` file is our reformatted citations.  We open it in OpenOffice,
scroll down to wherever we want our bibliography and insert the html document:

    Insert -> File : 'MyDoc.bib.html'

It is often helpful to adjust the spacing of the list.  Do this by
highlighting the bibliography, then:

    Format -> Bullets and Numbering
    Then adjust 'Minimum space number <-> text'

Wallah!  A beautifully formatted bibliography!
